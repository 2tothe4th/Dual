# Overview
Dual is a Haskell package, similar to Data.Complex, to work with [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number). Dual numbers are constructed using the `Dual` constructor. Specifically, `Dual a b` = a + bÎµ. At the moment, `Num`, `Fractional`, and `Floating` (not complete) instances have been defined for dual numbers.
